# Semikart dashboard using React JS

Previously I did the same with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. In this, I build it with the React JS.

## Why I choosed React JS

React JS is the Frontend javascript library which allows to create sections as multiple components.
It is easier to debug and develop code easily. The code is also lightweighted.

### "React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native."
